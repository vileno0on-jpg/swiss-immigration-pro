Facilitated naturalization (naturalisation facilitée / Erleichterte Einbürgerung) provides a significantly accelerated pathway to Swiss citizenship for spouses and registered partners of Swiss citizens. Under LN Art. 21, eligible applicants can reduce the citizenship timeline from the standard 10 years to just 5 years, making this one of the most attractive citizenship pathways for those married to Swiss nationals.

### Legal Framework: Facilitated Naturalization for Spouses

**Swiss Nationality Law (LN Art. 21):**

Article 21 of the Swiss Nationality Law establishes facilitated naturalization for spouses of Swiss citizens, providing significantly reduced residency requirements compared to ordinary naturalization.

**LN Art. 21 para. 1 - Formal Conditions:**
Article 21 para. 1 establishes two formal conditions for facilitated naturalization:
1. **Marriage Duration:** Must have lived in marriage (union conjugale) with Swiss citizen for 3 years (let. a)
2. **Residence Requirement:** Must have resided in Switzerland for 5 years total, with the year preceding application in Switzerland (let. b)

**Comparison with Ordinary Naturalization:**
- **Ordinary Naturalization (LN Art. 9):** 10 years total residence, 3 years in 5 years preceding, C permit required
- **Facilitated Naturalization (LN Art. 21):** 5 years total residence, 1 year preceding, B permit sufficient

**Material Conditions:**
While formal conditions are reduced, material conditions (integration) are similar to ordinary naturalization:
- Successful integration (LN Art. 12)
- Familiarity with Swiss living conditions
- No threat to security

**Key Advantage:**
The primary advantage is the reduced residency requirement (5 years vs. 10 years) and the fact that a B permit (rather than C permit) is sufficient for application, potentially allowing application 5 years earlier than ordinary naturalization.`,

Understanding formal conditions for facilitated naturalization is essential for successful application.

**Marriage Duration (LN Art. 21 para. 1 let. a):**
- Must have lived in marriage (union conjugale) with Swiss citizen for minimum 3 years
- Marriage must be validly concluded (Switzerland or abroad)
- Union conjugale must be effective and stable (OLN Art. 10)
- Must continue throughout application procedure

**Residence Requirement (LN Art. 21 para. 1 let. b):**
- 5 years total residence in Switzerland (vs. 10 years for ordinary naturalization)
- 1 year continuous residence in year preceding application (vs. 3 years in 5 years for ordinary)
- Residence must be legal and effective
- Only B, C, F (50%), and legitimation cards count

**Permit Requirements:**
- B permit sufficient (vs. C permit required for ordinary naturalization)
- Permit must be valid at application and throughout procedure
- Family reunification permits typically qualify

**Union Conjugale Requirements (OLN Art. 10):**
- Effective marital union (community of life)
- Common household typically required (exceptions possible)
- Stable union with intention to continue
- Must exist at application and decision`,

          content: `## Material Conditions: Integration Assessment for Spouses

Material conditions for facilitated naturalization are similar to ordinary naturalization, though marriage to Swiss citizen creates presumption of easier integration.

**Integration Criteria (LN Art. 12):**
Same integration criteria as ordinary naturalization apply:
- Respect of security and public order (let. a)
- Respect of constitutional values (let. b)
- Language proficiency: B1 minimum (let. c)
- Economic participation or training (let. d)
- Family integration support (let. e)

**Presumption of Integration:**
Marriage to Swiss citizen creates presumption that applicant has:
- Familiarized with Swiss living conditions more easily
- Stronger ties to Switzerland
- Greater integration potential

However, this presumption can be rebutted if evidence shows lack of integration.

**Assessment Standards:**
- Integration assessment generally similar to ordinary naturalization
- Some flexibility possible due to marriage presumption
- Strong emphasis on union conjugale effectiveness`,

            'Material conditions are similar to ordinary naturalization but with presumption of easier integration',
            'Integration criteria (LN Art. 12) apply: security/order, constitutional values, language B1, economic participation',
            'Marriage to Swiss citizen creates presumption of stronger ties and easier integration',

          content: `## Application Procedure: Complete Step-by-Step Guide

The facilitated naturalization procedure is primarily federal (SEM-led) rather than cantonal, simplifying the process compared to ordinary naturalization.

**Step 1: Eligibility Verification**
- Verify 3-year marriage requirement met
- Verify 5-year residence requirement met
- Verify 1-year preceding residence requirement met
- Confirm B permit validity

**Step 2: Documentation Preparation**
- Marriage certificate (certified/apostilled)
- Proof of residence (5 years total, 1 year preceding)
- B permit documentation
- Language proficiency certificate (B1)
- Integration documentation
- Employment/training documentation
- Criminal record certificate
- Health insurance proof

**Step 3: Application Submission**
- Submit to SEM (federal authority)
- Pay application fees
- Receive confirmation

**Step 4: SEM Processing**
- Federal examination of formal conditions
- Integration assessment
- Investigation and verification
- Consultation with canton of origin

**Step 5: Decision**
- SEM issues decision
- If approved: Naturalization granted
- If refused: Appeal possible`,
          keyPoints: [
            'Application submitted directly to SEM (federal) rather than cantonal authority',
