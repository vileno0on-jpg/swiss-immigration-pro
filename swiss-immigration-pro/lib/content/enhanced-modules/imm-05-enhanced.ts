### Legal Framework: Embassy Submission Requirements

Swiss immigration law (VZAE Art. 15-22) establishes the framework for visa and permit issuance at Swiss diplomatic missions. The embassy submission process is the final administrative step in the permit application procedure, following cantonal approval. Understanding the legal requirements ensures smooth processing and prevents delays.

**Jurisdictional Authority:**
Swiss embassies and consulates operate under the authority of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) and act on behalf of the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) in processing visa and permit applications. The embassy's role is to verify identity, collect biometric data, and issue the physical permit document following cantonal approval.

**Permit Validity Requirements:**
Permits issued at embassies typically require entry to Switzerland within 90 days of issuance (VZAE Art. 17). Failure to enter within this period may invalidate the permit, requiring new application procedures. Understanding this timeline is critical for travel planning.

### Swiss Diplomatic Network Structure

Switzerland maintains an extensive network of embassies, consulates-general, and honorary consulates covering virtually every country worldwide. Understanding the jurisdictional structure and service capabilities of different mission types is essential for efficient submission.
