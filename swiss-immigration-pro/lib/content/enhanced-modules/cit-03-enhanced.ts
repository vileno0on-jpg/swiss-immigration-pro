Third-generation naturalization (naturalisation facilitée pour la troisième génération / Erleichterte Einbürgerung für die dritte Generation) provides a significantly simplified pathway to Swiss citizenship for individuals born in Switzerland whose grandparents also lived in Switzerland. Under LN Art. 24-26, eligible applicants benefit from reduced requirements, simplified procedures, and faster processing compared to ordinary or facilitated naturalization.
