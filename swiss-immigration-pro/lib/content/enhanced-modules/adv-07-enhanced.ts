### Legal Framework: Mandatory Health Insurance

**Federal Health Insurance Act (KVG - Krankenversicherungsgesetz, SR 832.10):**

Swiss health insurance is legally mandated under the Federal Health Insurance Act (KVG), which establishes the universal healthcare system. Key legal requirements include:

**KVG Art. 3 - Mandatory Insurance:**
Article 3 of the Health Insurance Act establishes that all persons resident in Switzerland must be insured with a Swiss health insurer for basic insurance coverage. This requirement applies to:
- All Swiss residents (including foreign nationals with residence permits)
- Within 3 months of taking up residence in Switzerland
- Newborns (must be insured from birth)
- Students and persons in training

**Exemptions (KVG Art. 3 para. 3):**
- Diplomats and their family members
- Personnel of international organizations with diplomatic immunity
- Persons with very short stays (less than 3 months)
- Certain exceptional cases as specified by federal regulations

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
Failure to obtain mandatory health insurance within 3 months results in:
- Automatic assignment to an insurer by the cantonal authority
- Back-dated premiums charged from the date of residence
- Potential legal consequences and fines
- Impact on permit renewal applications

### The Three-Pillar Healthcare System

**Pillar 2: Occupational Health Insurance (Unfallversicherung / Assurance-accidents)**
- Mandatory for employees
- Covers work-related accidents and occupational diseases
- Employer-provided and paid
- Managed through SUVA (Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund) or private insurers

**Pillar 3: Complementary Insurance (Zusatzversicherung / Assurance complémentaire)**
- Voluntary private insurance
- Covers services not included in basic insurance
- Includes hospital room upgrades, dental care, alternative medicine, better medications
- Subject to health screening and risk assessment
- Premiums vary based on age, health status, and coverage level

### Basic Insurance Coverage (Pillar 1)

- Medical consultations and treatments

- Based on income and family size
- Reduces monthly premiums significantly
- Application through cantonal authorities
