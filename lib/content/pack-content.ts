Welcome to **Swiss Immigration Pro** – this free blueprint gives you a trust-building overview of the exact legal frameworks we use to help clients secure permits faster.

## 🇨🇭 The Three Fastest Legal Pathways

### 1. EU/EFTA Freedom of Movement (FMPA)
- **Legal basis**: Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (FMPA), AuG (SR 142.20) Art. 2, VZAE (SR 142.201) Art. 7-23  
- **Turnaround**: 2-4 weeks once documents are ready  
- **What you need**: Employment contract or proof of self-employment, health insurance, registration with the commune within 14 days  
- **Official source**: [SEM – EU/EFTA Citizens](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/arbeit/eu_efta-angehoerige.html)

### 2. Highly Skilled Non-EU Specialists (Permits L & B)
- **Legal basis**: AuG Art. 21-24, VZAE Art. 23 (L permits), Art. 18-25 (B permits)  
- **Quota availability (2025)**: 4,000 L + 4,500 B permits for third-country nationals ([SEM Quota Bulletin](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/arbeit/nicht-eu_efta-angehoerige/arbeitsmarkt.html))  
- **What we optimise**: Salary benchmarks, employer motivation letter, cantonal selection, timing before quotas tighten

### 3. Corporate Transfers & Innovation Visas
- **Legal basis**: AuG Art. 19, VZAE Art. 28-30 for intra-company transfers; Start-up facilitation per SEM practice notes  
- **Why it works**: Cantons prioritise key industries (Tech, Pharma, MedTech) and innovation seats  
- **Our support**: Employer compliance pack, innovation evidence checklist, cantonal liaison brief

---

## ✅ What People Get Wrong (And How You Avoid It)

1. **Missing legal citations** – cantonal case officers expect explicit references. We provide templates that cite the correct article every time.  
2. **Wrong canton** – picking Zurich first can reduce non-EU success to **15%**. With data, we redirect you to Basel-Stadt or Zug to reach **35-45%**.  
3. **Late quota submission** – November filings see <10% approvals. We send automated reminders based on AuG Art. 20 timing requirements.

---

## 🎯 How We Guide You End-to-End

- **Document Braintrust**: We keep an updated library of SEM circulars, cantonal checklists (Zurich, Geneva, Basel) and employment law templates.  
- **Permit Probability Engine**: Our calculators blend SEM quota data with SECO salary contributions to flag risk areas instantly.

- **Success Playbooks Audited Quarterly** – we update content after each SEM bulletin so you stay 100% compliant.
