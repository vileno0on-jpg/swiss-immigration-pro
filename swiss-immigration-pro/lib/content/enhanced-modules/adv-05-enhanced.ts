### Legal Framework: Language Requirements

**Citizenship Requirements:**
Under Swiss Nationality Law (LN Art. 12 para. 1 let. c, OLN Art. 6), citizenship applicants must demonstrate ability to communicate in everyday situations in a national language. The minimum requirement is B1 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), though many cantons prefer B2 level for stronger applications.

**Work Permit Requirements:**
While not explicitly required by federal law for all work permits, cantonal authorities frequently require language proficiency for non-EU/EFTA applicants (LEI Art. 23 para. 2). Language requirements vary by canton, industry, and position level, typically ranging from B1 to B2 depending on circumstances.

**Integration Requirements:**
For C permit (permanent residence) applications and renewals, language proficiency is assessed as part of integration evaluation (LEI Art. 58a, OASA Art. 62). Integration requirements typically require A2-B1 level minimum, with higher levels strengthening applications.

### Regional Language Requirements

**German-Speaking Regions (Zurich, Basel, Bern, etc.):**
- Work permits: Typically German B1-B2 required
- Citizenship: German B1 minimum (B2 preferred)
- Integration: German A2-B1
- Swiss German: Often preferred over High German in professional contexts

**French-Speaking Regions (Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, etc.):**
- Work permits: Typically French B1-B2 required
